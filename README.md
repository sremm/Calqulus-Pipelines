# Calqulus Pipelines

This repository contains the pipelines used in the Calqulus Module â€“ our official, supported life science motion capture analyses.

A Calqulus pipeline contains the steps needed to calculate all parameters used in our web reports. 

You can use these pipelines to learn how the Calqulus Module analyses are calculated and to contribute with improvements. You can also use them as a starting point for your own Calqulus analysis by simply creating a fork and start editing.

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://github.com/qualisys/Calqulus-Steps/blob/main/docs/index.md) in the Qualisys/Calqulus-Steps repository covers how the pipelines are structured and how to use the different steps.
